## SimpleToDo
This is a simple todo web "program" with an API.  
Code still looks pretty scuft but works never the less.  

## Installation
To create the database just run the [creation query](https://github.com/ErikSchnittker/SimpleToDo/blob/master/db/database.sql).    
You might want to change the [connection details](https://github.com/ErikSchnittker/SimpleToDo/blob/master/db/connection.php) though.   
PS: You might also want to change the css inside the css folder.  
## API
The API currently has no authentication!  
DO NOT PUT THIS ON AN EXPOSED SERVER.
## Prerequisites
An Apache based web-server with ```AllowOverride All```
