## SimpleToDo
This is a simple todo web "program".  
Code is pretty scuft but works never the less.  

Feels free to use this however you want.  

To create the database just run the [creation query](https://github.com/ErikSchnittker/SimpleToDo/blob/master/db/database.sql).  
You might want to change the database name though.  
Than you will also need to change it in the [connection configuration](https://github.com/ErikSchnittker/SimpleToDo/blob/master/db/connection.php).  
The rest should be a just work thing.  
PS: You might also want to change the css inside the css folder.
